This is a simple menu structure I created for work to organize wifi information.

All works well inside of vscode, but when I double click the index.html file on my desk top the svg assigned to the ::before selector does not show up before each menu item. I have checked the url to the images folder, and all appears correct. I have also tried using webkit.
